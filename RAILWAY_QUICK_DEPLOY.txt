Since CLI is having issues, use Railway Dashboard:

STEP 1: Go to https://railway.app
        - Login with your account
        - Click on your project: devbhoomi-backend

STEP 2: Click "New" → "GitHub Repo"
        - Select your repository
        - Or click "Empty Project" and we'll upload files

STEP 3: Click "Variables" tab
        Add these 3 variables:
        
        1. MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://himanshusangwan141_db_user:Lakshay123@cluster0.zxau600.mongodb.net/devbhoomi-cyberthon?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        
        2. JWT_SECRET = devbhoomi_cyberthon_secret_key_2024
        
        3. NODE_ENV = production

STEP 4: Go to "Settings" tab
        - Build Command: npm install
        - Start Command: node server.js
        - Root Directory: /

STEP 5: Click "Deploy"
        Wait 2-3 minutes

STEP 6: Get your URL
        - Open "Settings" → "Networking"
        - Copy "Public Domain" URL
        Example: https://devbhoomi-backend-production.up.railway.app

STEP 7: For Frontend
        Go to vercel.com and deploy
        Add environment variable:
        VITE_API_URL = (your Railway URL from step 6)
